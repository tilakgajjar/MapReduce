# MapReduce

The three questions that you have to answer about this data set are:
	•	Sales breakdown by product category across all of our stores. 
	•	The monetary value for the highest individual sale for each separate store.
	•	The total sales value across all the stores, and the total number of sales. Assume there is only one reducer.
