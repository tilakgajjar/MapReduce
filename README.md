# MapReduce

The three questions that you have to answer about this data set are:
	•	Instead of breaking the sales down by store, instead give us a sales breakdown by product category across all of our     stores. 
	•	Find the monetary value for the highest individual sale for each separate store.
	•	Find the total sales value across all the stores, and the total number of sales. Assume there is only one reducer.
